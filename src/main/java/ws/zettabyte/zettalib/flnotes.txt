Note: in order to avoid being an architecture astronaut, I'm gonna go all library-ish with this one rather than framework-ish.
And so, we should end up with a lot of annotations and very few big ol' black box classes that just consume our rigid,
hierarchical class structures.

Big ol' inheritance trees are a no-no here in general.

Annotations are a good thing. Inline classes, too.

Parts of item and block init to do declaratively:
Config (of all things) 
Name, unlocalized name
**Game registry shit**
Creative tab-eroonies 
Feature divisions
