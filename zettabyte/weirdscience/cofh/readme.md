This entire package (weirdscience.cofh) was originally copied from Team 
Cult of the Full Hub's "CoFHLib," which has a github page located at 
https://github.com/KingLemming/CoFHLib. This is legally, ethically, and 
technically the right thing to do, as the library was released under the 
Lesser GNU Public License, and the authors of the library recommend 
"shadowing" (copying and then modifying) its files.

That being said, you cannot and should not expect these files to be 
identical to Vanilla CoFHLib. It is necessary to modify some code for 
some of the classes to function without the proprietary CoFHCore, to 
start with.

(Note: I had planned and begun a gigantic GUI system but not only is 
that a bunch of effort reinventing the wheel (hell, I want to become a 
better programmer, and grinding away reinventing wheels might even be 
beneficial) but more importantly putting all that effort into a GUI 
system might tempt me to make the mod more GUI-reliant, which I'm 
against from a game design perspective. You can still find the 
beginnings of this GUI system at 
https://github.com/NotGyro/WeirdScience/tree/system-gui )
